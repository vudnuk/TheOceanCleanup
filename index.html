            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><em>The Ocean Cleanup</em> is a nonprofit engineering environmental organization based in the
                Netherlands, founded
                in 2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and Dutch origin who serves as its
                CEO. It develops technology to extract plastic pollution from the oceans and intercept it in rivers
                before it can reach the ocean. The organization conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic
                pollution. It has conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre, the Mega Expedition and the
                Aerial Expedition, and continues to publish scientific papers.</p>

            <h2>Marine Plastic Debris</h2>
            <p>It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine debris in the worldwide ocean
                as of the end of 2013, assuming that 1.4% of global plastics produced from 1950 to 2013 has entered the
                ocean and has accumulated there. 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's
                oceans each year. Asia was the leading source of mismanaged plastic waste, with China alone accounting
                for 2.4 million metric tons. In 2017 the UN estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish
                in the oceans, if substantial measures are not taken.</p>

                    alt="Oceanic gyres" title="Oceanic gyres">
                <figcaption>Garbage patches have formed in all five oceanic gyres.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. However, it has been found that plastic debris
                concentrates in the oceanic gyres where it forms extensive garbage patches. Of those, the North Pacific
                garbage patch is the biggest, with an estimated area of 1.6 million square kilometers. Plastic
                accumulating in these patches photodegrades into smaller and smaller particles and releases toxic and
                endocrine chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA).</p>
            <p>Plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures
                each year. Larger plastics (called "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive
                tracts of larger animals when consumed by them and can cause starvation through restricting the movement
                of food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is full. Microplastics on
                the other hand harm smaller marine life. For example, pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our
                oceanâ€™s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life
                as well as human consumers.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In 2011, aged 16, Dutch Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece. He decided
                to devote a high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was
                considered impossible to clean up.
            </p>
            <p>Slat discontinued his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to devote his time to developing his
                idea. He founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013. The group's mission is to develop advanced technologies to
                rid the world's oceans of plastic. In June 2014, the Ocean Cleanup published a 528-page feasibility
                study about the project's potential.</p>
            <p>The Ocean Cleanup is mainly funded by donations and sponsors. As of November 2019 it has made a little
                over $35 million from sponsors including Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter
                Thiel, Julius Baer Foundation and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup raised over $2 million with the help of a
                crowdfunding campaign in 2014.

            <h2>Technological Approaches</h2>
            <blockquote><em>"Technology is the most potent agent of change. It is an amplifier of our human
                    capabilities"</em> &mdash; Boyan Slat</blockquote>
            <h3 id="oceanCleanup">Ocean Cleanup</h3>
            <p>The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized in the ocean gyres. These structures act
                as a containment boom. The floater drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine
                debris. A permeable screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris.</p>
            <p><em>System 001</em>, deployed in September 2018, consisted of a 600 meters long barrier with a 3 meters
                wide skirt that hangs beneath it. It was unmanned and incorporates solar-powered monitoring and
                navigation systems, including GPS, cameras, lanterns and an automatic identification system (AIS) for
                vessel traffic services. System 001 encountered difficulties retaining the plastic collected. After two
                month of operation, during which the system had collected 2,000 kilograms of plastic, mechanical stress
                caused an 18-meter section of the structure to detach, and the rig was taken to Hawaii for repair.</p>
            <figure class="floatLeft">

            </figure>
            <p>In June 2019 after four months of root cause analyses and redesign, a new revamped <em>System 001/B</em>
                was deployed. In August, the team announced that after trying multiple alternatives, a water-borne
                parachute attached to slow the system, and expanding the cork line used to hold the screen in place
                would be tested. In October they announced that the new system successfully captured and collected
                plastic, and even microplastics. The model was also more efficient and smaller, making offshore
                adjustments possible.</p>
            <h3 id="riverInterception">River Interception</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>Responding to criticism that filtering devices closer to shore are easier to maintain, and likely to
                recover more plastic per dollar spent, the organization introduced an additional technology in October
                2019 &mdash; <em>the River Interceptor</em>. Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating arms to
                direct floating waste into the collection conveyor, which dumps trash into dumpsters on a detachable
                barge below. When full, the collection stops until the barge is removed, emptied and returned to the
                Interceptor.</p>
            <p>The first three Interceptor systems have been deployed in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Dominican Republic.
                In June 2021, the organization announced the deployment of 15 further Interceptors thanks to a
                partnership with the <em>Coca Cola Company</em> &mdash; the world's largest producer of plastic waste.
            </p>
            <h3 id="plasticRecycling">Plastic Recycling</h3>
            <p>In October 2020, The Ocean Cleanup launched their first product made from plastic collected from the
                Great Pacific Garbage Patch, <em>The Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses</em>. The organization worked with DNV GL
                to develop a certification for plastic from water sources and the sunglasses were certified to originate
                from the GPGP. Revenue from the sale of recycling products go into their continued cleanup projects.

            <h2>Mitigation</h2>
            <p>While the cleanup of existing plastic pollution is important, it is equally vital to tackle the problem
                at its source. The problem is not "out there" in the ocean, it is with each and every one of us.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some simple suggestions to reduce your contribution to plastic debris:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring reusable bags and totes when shopping.</li>
                <li>Use a reusable bottle or mug for your beverages, even when ordering from a to-go shop.</li>
                <li>Avoid plastic straws and disposable cutlery.</li>
                <li>Cook more often to reduce your use of plastic-heavy takeout containers.</li>
                <li>Bring your own container for take-out or your restaurant doggy-bag.</li>
                <li>Buy in bulk. Avoid individually packaged goods.</li>
                <li>Buy local, unwrapped produce.</li>
                <li>Use refill stations for cleaning products.</li>
            </ul>
